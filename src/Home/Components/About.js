      <h4>About</h4>
      <p>
        As a full stack software engineer with a passion for mathematics, I
        approach full stack development with a strong focus on problem-solving
        and building scalable, user-focused applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        My love for problem-solving has been a constant in my life, initially
        expressed through mathematics. However, as I delved into coding, I found
        a more practical and enjoyable outlet for this passion, allowing me to
        apply my problem-solving skills in a dynamic and rewarding manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        Iâ€™m experienced across the full SDLC, from scalable infrastructure,
        backend APIs, to responsive frontends.
